/**
 * Request DTO for completing Google OAuth2 registration.
 *
 * <p>Carries the username and password chosen by the user during the final
 * step of Google OAuth2 registration. The email and name are retrieved from
 * the verified Google profile stored in the HTTP session as an
 * {@link OAuthRegistrationSession}, not from this request body — this
 * prevents client-side tampering with identity data.</p>
 *
 * <p>The user can subsequently authenticate via either Google OAuth2 or
 * username/password login, providing flexibility in authentication methods.</p>
 *
 * @param username the unique username chosen by the user (3-30 alphanumeric
 *                 characters or underscores)
 * @param password the password chosen by the user
